This SQL project aimed to develop a comprehensive auction strategy for a new IPL franchise by analyzing historical IPL data to assemble a strong and balanced team. The analysis centered around two tables: one capturing granular records of each ball bowled, including runs scored, wickets taken, and player details, and the other comprising venue details, umpire names, man of the match awards, and match-level statistics. By joining these tables, multiple key insights were extracted. Top 10 batters were identified by calculating metrics such as batting averages, strike rates, and boundary percentages. Top 10 bowlers were analyzed based on economy rates, bowling averages, and strike rates, while the best-performing wicketkeepers and all-rounders were also ranked. Further analysis included the total boundaries hit by each team, the top 5 bowlers who conceded the most runs, the most impactful partnerships, and team-wise performance trends. SQL functions like AVG(), SUM(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), EXTRACT(), GROUP BY, DISTINCT, and ORDER BY enabled detailed aggregation and filtering of data. Advanced queries combined data points to uncover nuanced insights, such as players' performance under specific conditions or at particular venues.
To enhance interpretation and communication, Tableau was used to create visualizations for each finding. This integrated approach ensured a comprehensive understanding of player and team performance, empowering the franchise to make informed decisions during the auction process and build a competitive squad
